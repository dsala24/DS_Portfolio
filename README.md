## Projects 
### 1. [Predictive Machine Learning Analytics for Telecom Customer Churn](https://github.com/dsala24/Telecom-Customer-Churn/tree/main) 
 - Demonstrated expertise in business analytics, encompassing a range of objectives, such as understanding business cases, classifier models implementation, data handling, exploratory data analysis, and interactive data visualization.
 - Proficiently prepared and employed data to develop and train logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, and naive Bayes classifier models for predicting customer churn.
 - The results of the comparison between different classification models reveal that the Random Forest model achieved an F1 score of 90%.
 - Future work will aim to enhance the model further through the utilization of advanced techniques such as grid search.

### 2. [Medical Insurance Premium Prediction with Machine Learning](https://github.com/dsala24/Medical-Insurance-ML/tree/main)
 - Collected data from a diverse sample of insured individuals, covering age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, region, and medical charges.
 - Conducted feature selection to pinpoint key factors for predicting insurance premiums.
 - Utilized linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN) models, resulting in R-squared values of 0.69 and 0.74.
 - Optimized ANN hyperparameters, increasing the R-squared value to 0.97.

### 3. [Deep Learning Respiratory Disease Detection and Classification](https://github.com/dsala24/Respiratory-Disease-DL/tree/main)
 - Compiled a medical imaging dataset with X-rays and CT scans featuring respiratory disease conditions, including Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, and Covid-19.
 - Explored deep learning models, with a focus on employing ResNet50 in conjunction with additional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks.
 - Conducted model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning, leading to the choice of a robust CNN architecture.
 - Achieved effective classification of healthy and viral pneumonia (F1 > 87%), with room for improvement in bacterial pneumonia (F1 < 63%) and Covid-19 (F1 < 75%).
 - Future work will focus on enhancing bacterial pneumonia and Covid-19 classification.
