## Projects 
### 1. [Predictive Machine Learning Analytics for Telecom Customer Churn](https://github.com/dsala24/Telecom-Customer-Churn/tree/main) 
 - Demonstrated expertise in business analytics, encompassing a range of objectives, such as understanding business case studies, theory behind classifier models, data handling, exploratory data analysis, and interactive data visualization.
 - Proficiently prepared and employed data to develop and train logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest, K-nearest neighbor, and naive Bayes classifier models for predicting customer churn.
 - The results of the comparison between different classification models reveal that the Random Forest model achieved an F1 score of approximately 90%. Future work will aim to enhance the model further through the implementation of advanced techniques such as grid search.

### 2. [Medical Insurance Premium Prediction with Machine Learning](https://github.com/dsala24/Medical-Insurance-ML/tree/main)
 -  Data was gathered from a diverse sample of insured individuals, encompassing variables such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, region, and medical charges. 
 -  Feature selection was carried out to identify the most influential attributes in predicting insurance premiums.
 -  Optimized linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble models to determine predictive performance.

### 3. [Deep Learning Respiratory Disease Detection and Classification](https://github.com/dsala24/Respiratory-Disease-DL/tree/main)
 -  A dataset consisting of medical imaging data, including X-rays and CT scans of chest ailments, was assembled. The dataset comprises cases of various chest diseases, including Viral and Bacterial pneumonia, as well as Covid-19.
 -  Deep learning models, such as CNNs, were considered for their suitability in image classification tasks. 
 -  Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning were performed, resulting in the selection of a robust CNN architecture.
 -  The model effectively classified healthy and viral pneumonia (F1 > 87%), while future improvements are needed for bacterial pneumonia (F1 < 63%) and Covid-19 (F1 < 75%).
